## AI ~~Hype~~ Trends & Business School Education {.fatinline}

-   [AI Index Report](https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/HAI_AI-Index-Report_2023.pdf) trends point to a number Business School educational needs:

-   Safety

-   Ethics

-   Regulation and compliance

-   Risk & Control

## AI ~~Hype~~ : Is it different this time? {.fatinline}

-   Historically, the positive fallout from technology adoption waves, empowers some humans, typically to the detriment of others.

-   This time is could be different, as AI is the first tool in history:

    -   that can "make decision" by itself
    -   that can create "new ideas" by itself

-   Such properties have lead to the development of the areas of AI Safety.

::: {data-id="box3" auto-animate-delay="0.2" style="background: #e83e8c; width: 200px; height: 150px; margin: 10px;"}
**Transformer**
:::
:::

::: {.content-box-blue .small}
-   **Generative**
    -   Denotes the model's ability to fabricate text data that is coherent and pertains to the given input.
-   **Pre-trained**
    -   Refers to the initial training phase where the model acquires a foundational understanding of language and context from large datasets, facilitating nuanced responses in specific tasks later on.
-   **Transformer**
    -   Pertains to the Transformer architecture foundational to the model, a significant advancement in natural language processing introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017), which employs attention mechanisms to understand the contextual relationships between words in a sentence more precisely.
:::

::: notes
**Generative**: This signifies that the model can generate text data. In other words, it can produce new text that is coherent and contextually relevant based on the input it receives.

**Transformer**: This refers to the Transformer architecture upon which the model is based. Introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017, the Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone in the field of natural language processing. It uses mechanisms like attention to better understand the context and relationships between words in a sentence.

## GPT framed using the AIMA definitions {.small}

### Thinking Humanly

While Generative AI models like GPT do not exactly replicate human cognition, they do aim to mimic human-like text generation capabilities. By being trained on a vast corpus of human-generated text, these models try to capture the nuances and complexities of human language.

### Thinking Rationally

From a rational perspective, Generative AI does not focus on logical reasoning as its primary function. However, it does try to predict the "next word" in a sequence as accurately as possible based on probabilistic models, thus making a "rational" choice among the possible word options.

### Acting Humanly

Large Language Models excel in this category. They are designed to generate text that is indistinguishable from that written by a human. This is similar to passing a Turing Test in the domain of natural language text, where the generated text is often coherent, contextually relevant, and can even be creative or emotional.

### Acting Rationally

In the rational agent framework, these models act to maximize an objective function during the training phase. The objective is usually to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual next word in a sequence. So, in that sense, they are acting "rationally" to achieve the best performance based on the data they were trained on.

::: notes
### Summary

Generative AI using Large Language Models can be seen as a hybrid in the context of AIMA's definitions. They lean towards "Acting Humanly" in their primary function, which is to generate human-like text. However, they are built and operate on principles that aim for rational action, specifically maximizing the likelihood of their predictions given the data they have seen. While they don't fully encapsulate logical reasoning (Thinking Rationally) or strive to replicate human cognition (Thinking Humanly), they represent an intersection of acting both humanly and rationally in the specific domain of natural language text.
